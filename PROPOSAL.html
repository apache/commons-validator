<title>Proposal for Validator Library Package</title>
</head>
<body>

<div align="center">
<h1>Proposal for <em>Validator</em> Package</h1>
</div>

<h3>(0) Rationale</h3>

<p>There is a need for the validation of JavaBeans to validate 
user input from forms and validate business rules.  There is also a 
need to define different validation rules and error messages based on 
the user's locale.
</p>

<p>The Validator package will provide the capability to configure 
validators (validation methods) with different method signatures.  
So the basic framework can have an interface built on it to deal 
with validations on web layers, ejb layers, etc.
</p>

<h3>(1) Scope of the Package</h3>

<p>The package shall create and maintain a package that provides 
basic validation functionality.
</p>

<p>
The package should :
<ul>
<li>Provide in an easy way to define validations for fields</li>
<li>Provide internationalization support for validation rules and error messages.</li>
<li>Provide an easy way to define validators</li>
<li>Provide a way to store information in a validator definition so JavaScript client 
    side validation can be auto-generated matching the server side validation.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Non-goals:
<ul>
<li>This package does not auto-generate JavaScript client side code.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>(1.5) Interaction With Other Packages</h3>

<p><em>Validator</em> relies on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jakarta Regexp</li>
</ul>

<h3>(2) Required Jakarta-Commons Resources</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Commons BeanUtils</li>
  <li>Commons Collections</li>
  <li>Commons Digester</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>CVS Repository - New directory <code>validator</code> in the 
<code>jakarta-commons</code> CVS repository.</li>

<li>Initial Committers - The list is provided below. </li>

<li>Mailing List - Discussions will take place on the general
<em>dev@commons.apache.org</em> mailing list. To help list
subscribers identify messages of interest, it is suggested that the
message subject of messages about this component be prefixed with
[Validator].</li>

<li>Bugzilla - New component "Validator" under the "Commons" product
category, with appropriate version identifiers as needed.</li>

<li>Jyve FAQ - New category "commons-validator" (when available).</li>
</ul>


<h3>(4) Initial Committers</h3>

<p>The initial committers on the Validator component shall be:</p>

<ul>
   <li><a href="mailto:dwinterfeldt@apache.org">David Winterfeldt</a></li>
</ul>
