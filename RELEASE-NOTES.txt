DEPRECATIONS
============

 * Most of the org.apache.commons.validator classes have been deprecated,
   in favour of the new org.apache.commons.validator.routines classes.

OTHER NOTES
============

Users should be aware of the following potential issues with migration:

 * The protected method validator.EmailValidator.isValidIpAddress() previously
   exposed a Jakarta ORO class via its signature.  The signature has been
   modified to accept a a java.lang.String and is not therefore not compatible.
   However, this class is deprecated and clients should use the equivalent
   class in the validator.routines package.

* Invocations of the method GenericValidator.matchRegexp() should be inspected
  for semantic differences between Jakarta ORO and Java regular expressions.
