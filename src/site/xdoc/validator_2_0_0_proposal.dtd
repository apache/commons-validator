    Proposed DTD for the Validator Rules Configuration File, Version 2.0.0

    To allow for XML validation of your rules configuration
    file, include the following DOCTYPE element at the beginning (after
    the "xml" declaration):

    <!DOCTYPE form-validation PUBLIC
     "-//Apache Software Foundation//DTD Commons Validator Rules Configuration 2.0.0//EN"
     "http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/dtds/validator_2_0_0.dtd">

-->

<!--
This is a proposal for what Validator's 2.0 XML configuration file will
look like.  Comments and suggestions are highly appreciated.  The goal is 
to simplify the configuration as much as possible and use bean semantics rather
than HTML form terminology.  Some changes include:

- The following elements were renamed (old name == new name):
form-validation == validator-config
formset == bean-set
form == bean
field == property
javascript == script

- The global element has been removed.  It provided no real value so "constant"
and "validator" elements are now declared directly inside "validator-config".

- The validator name attribute was renamed to id and is now defined as an ID
type so that other attributes can be defined as IDREF or IDREFS.  This allows
Digester to more strictly validate the XML and notify users of errors.
Note that IDREFS attributes are whitespace separated rather than comma separated.

- The old validator jsFunction and jsFunctionName attributes were moved to the
script element as src and function-name.  This will require a new Script class
for Digester to populate this info with.  This has a nice side effect of 
refactoring the javascript loading code out of ValidatorAction and into Script.
ValidatorAction will have a getScript() method to get at this object.

- The validator element's classname and methodParams attributes were renamed to
class and params for simplicity.

- While JavaScript is likely to remain the primary scripting language, we can
treat scripts more generically by leaving out all "js" references; hence the
renaming of javascript to script.  Thick clients (ie. Swing/SWT) may want to 
use Python, Ruby, etc. as their scripting language.

- The msg and arg elements' name attribute was renamed to validator to make it
clear that you're not naming the msg but specifying which validator the msg
applies to.

     Defines the properties to be validated. In a
     web application, a field would also correspond to a control on
     a HTML form. To validate the properties, the validator works through
     a JavaBean representation. The field element accepts these 
     attributes:

     name            The name of the bean property.

     depends         The whitespace delimited list of validator ids to 
                     apply against this field. For the field to succeed, all the
                     validators must succeed.

     page            Only fields with a "page" attribute
                     value that is equal to or less than the page property
                     on the form JavaBean are processed. This is useful when
                     using a "wizard" approach to completing a large form,
                     to ensure that a page is not skipped.
