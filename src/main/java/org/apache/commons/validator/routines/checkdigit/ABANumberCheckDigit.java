/**
 * Modulus 10 <b>ABA Number</b> (or <b>Routing Transit Number</b> (RTN)) Check Digit
 * calculation/validation.
 *
 * <p>
 * ABA Numbers (or Routing Transit Numbers) are a nine digit numeric code used
 * to identify American financial institutions for things such as checks or deposits
 * (ABA stands for the American Bankers Association).
 * </p>
 *
 * Check digit calculation is based on <i>modulus 10</i> with digits being weighted
 * based on their position (from right to left) as follows:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Digits 1, 4 and &amp; 7 are weighted 1</li>
 *   <li>Digits 2, 5 and &amp; 8 are weighted 7</li>
 *   <li>Digits 3, 6 and &amp; 9 are weighted 3</li>
 * </ul>
 *
