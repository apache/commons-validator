/**
 * <b>Check Digit</b> calculation and validation.
 * <p>
 * The logic for validating check digits has previously been
 * embedded within the logic for specific code validation, which
 * includes other validations such as verifying the format
 * or length of a code. {@link CheckDigit} provides for separating out
 * the check digit calculation logic enabling it to be more easily
 * tested and reused.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Although Commons Validator is primarily concerned with validation,
 * {@link CheckDigit} also defines behavior for calculating/generating check
 * digits, since it makes sense that users will want to (re-)use the
 * same logic for both. The {@link org.apache.commons.validator.routines.ISBNValidator}
 * makes specific use of this feature by providing the facility to validate ISBN-10 codes
 * and then convert them to the new ISBN-13 standard.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * CheckDigit is used by the new generic @link CodeValidator} implementation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Implementations</h2>
 * See the
 * <a href="package-summary.html">Package Summary</a> for a full
 * list of implementations provided within Commons Validator.
 *
 * @see org.apache.commons.validator.routines.CodeValidator
 * @version $Revision$
 * @since Validator 1.4
